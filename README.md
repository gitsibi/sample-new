When you created a new branch, made changes to the HTML file, and pushed it to GitHub, you saw an option to create a pull request. Here’s a simple explanation of what happened:
Explanation
Branches: A branch is like a separate copy of your project where you can make changes without affecting the original (main) version. In your case, the main branch was the original, and you created a new branch called result to work on.

Making Changes: When you modified the HTML file in the result branch and pushed it to GitHub, the changes were stored separately from the main branch.

Pull Request: When you clicked on "Create Pull Request," you were asking to merge the changes from the result branch into the main branch. Think of it like saying, “I’m done with my changes, and I’d like to add them to the main version.”

Merging: After you created the pull request and it got merged, the changes you made in the result branch were combined into the main branch. As a result, the main branch also had the updated HTML code.

Why Did the Main Branch Change?

Merging the pull request is what caused the changes from the result branch to be added to the main branch.
The pull request process is a way to review and approve changes before they are combined, but once merged, both branches have the updated content.

In Simple Words
Creating a pull request and merging it is like taking changes you made in a draft version and copying them into the final version. Once merged, the final version (main branch) includes all the updates you made.
